#Anagrmic Palindrome Function

##Overview

###This function checks if the strings provided in the bottom print statements are Anagramic palindromes which means they are both 
1. Anagram: two or more words or characters that have the same amount of characters 
2. Palindrome: is word or string that is spelled the same backwards and forwards

##The three print statements in the function are used to test if the strings are both a palindrome and an anagram

##Files
anagramic_palindrome.py
READ.me

##Big-O time complexity 
this function file is O(n) where n is the length of the two strings

##How to use
To run this program insure you have python installed
next you need to change directory to the file anagramic_palindrome.py
run the file by inputting: python anagramic_palindrome.py

###This function takes two strings as arguments and returns true if the two strings are both anagrams and palindromes false if otherwise
